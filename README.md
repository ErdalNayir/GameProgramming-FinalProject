## What is Survivor Game ?

You are a person in that game who try to survive by playing levels according to their rules. Me and my friend have inspired squid  game so You will find a lots of similarities between squid game and survivor game.

## How to Play ?

The game has two levels. I am going to explain them one by one;
<br />
<br />
* ### First Level
  * First level is played <b>"W"</b> and <b>"Left Shift"</b> button that, W is forward move and left shift is for running, on keyboard.<br />
  * You can run with combination of buttons which is W and Left Shift.(You have to press w first then press left shift for proper running animation).<br />
  * When music is stop you have to stand still to not to die. Once music starts again you can walk or run. 
  * ##### Goal is you have to reach finish line to pass first level and proceed to second level.
