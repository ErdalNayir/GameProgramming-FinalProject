# GameProgramming-FinalProject

This project has been developed by Erdal NAYÄ°R and Yakup Abaci for game programming class. <br />
<b>You can play this game from [here](https://erdal-nyr.itch.io/survivor-game)</b></br>

## What is Survivor Game ?

You are a person in that game who try to survive by playing levels according to their rules. Me and my friend have inspired squid  game so You will find a lots of similarities between squid game and survivor game.

## How to Play ?

The game has two levels. I am going to explain them one by one;
<br />
<br />
* ### First Level
  * First level is played <b>"W"</b> and <b>"Left Shift"</b> button that, W is forward move and left shift is for running, on keyboard.
  * You can run with combination of buttons which is W and Left Shift.(You have to press w first then press left shift for proper running animation).
  * When music stop, you have to stand still to not to die. Once music starts again you can walk or run. 
  * <b>Goal is you have to reach finish line to pass first level and proceed to second level.</b>

* ### Second Level 
  * In second level you need to use <b>"WASD"</b> buttons for moving, <b>"Space"</b> for jumping and <b>"Mouse"</b> for camera rotation.
  * You have to walk cross the glass path where a random glass has a random value assigned for determining the fragility of glass.
  * If you walk over the glass whose value makes itself fragile, it will break and you will fall down and die.
  * <b>Goal is you have to successfully guess which glass is fragile and which glass is not and walk cross the path by walk over the glasses which is not breakable.</b>
